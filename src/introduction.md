# Introduction

Welcome to the Arch Network developer documentation.

This book will guide you through installation of Arch's developer stack as well as provide you with the essential knowledge to create, deploy and interact with Arch smart contracts.

Arch Network leverages the security and ubiquity of Bitcoin to enhance decentralized applications by providing a computation environment. Arch facilitates complex operations on Bitcoin UTXOs through smart contracts executed in a zero-knowledge environment.

### Prerequirements

#### Rust
This book explores Arch Network's smart contracts. It is not a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) tutorial, and it assumes basic Rust knowledge. It is strongly recommended to understand the language first before proceeding. 

#### Bitcoin
Additionally, it is helpful to understand how [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) works, especially the [UTXO model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output). A good resource is [Saylor Academy's Bitcoin for Developers course](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=500) as well as [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) by [Andreas Antonopoulos](https://aantonop.com/).
