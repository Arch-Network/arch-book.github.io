# Introduction

Welcome to the Arch Network developer documentation.

As a developer building on the Arch Network, this guide will provide you with the essential knowledge to successfully create and deploy programs. The Arch Network harnesses the power of the RISC0 Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine (ZKVM) to execute programs securely and privately, ensuring that all computation proofs are verified by a robust network of verifier nodes.

Arch Network is leveraging the security and ubiquity of Bitcoin to enhance decentralized applications by providing a computation environment. Arch facilitates complex operations on Bitcoin UTXOs through smart contracts executed in a zero-knowledge environment.

This book will guide you through installation and onboarding all the way to understanding the intricacies of Arch smart contracts.
